# Factory loop

Tickets are GitHub issues on the repo in the current workspace. Work each open issue, then stop. Do not invent extra tickets.

**Build tickets do not close until a PR is reviewed and approved** (and merged when that is your gate). Opening the PR and commenting on the issue is mandatory; `answered` and **Close as completed** come only after approval.

Publishing: on every agent **stop**, project hooks commit tracked changes and push to `origin`. During the loop, stay on the ticket’s **feature branch** so the stop hook pushes there. When opening a PR, ensure the branch is pushed; you may commit on that branch if the hook has not run yet and the user asked for a PR.

## Resolve the repo and gh

1. Repo: `git remote get-url origin`. Use that `owner/repo` for every GitHub call.
2. `gh` may be missing from PATH. Use `gh` if it exists, otherwise `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` on Windows.
3. Read with `gh`. A fine-grained token often can list and view issues, then fail writes with `Resource not accessible by personal access token`. That token only covers repos owned by the signed-in user. This training repo is owned by someone else.
4. On that 403, do the rest of the writes in the browser while the user is signed in to GitHub. Do not ask for a password or token. If the browser is on the sign-in page, stop and ask them to sign in.

## Safety — no destructive actions

Do the ticket work in the repo. Never take destructive or irreversible actions, including:

- `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, branch deletes, or rewriting history
- Deleting files, folders, or projects unless the issue explicitly asks to remove that exact path
- Wiping user data, databases, or issue comments outside the normal close workflow
- Committing secrets (`.env`, credentials, tokens, real keys)

Prefer additive changes: create or extend files and project folders. Update `CLAUDE.md` when you add or rename a project.

## Ticket kinds

Read the title and body. Classify the ticket:

- **Build or feature** — asks for code, docs, hooks, skills, a new project folder, or changes inside an existing project.
- **Factual only** — asks a question with no repo deliverable.

Use the matching workflow below. Do not skip clarify, plan, browser verification, or **§6 pull request** on build tickets. Never close a build ticket without an approved PR (unless the user explicitly overrides in chat).

## Build or feature tickets

Do not guess when requirements, scope, UX, or acceptance criteria are unclear.

### 1. Signal

Add an 👀 reaction on the issue. If it is already there, leave it.

### 2. Clarify

List open assumptions as concrete questions.

- **User is in the chat:** ask those questions here and wait for answers. Do not implement yet.
- **Loop or issue-only context:** post the questions as an issue **Comment**. Leave the issue **open**. Stop until the issue thread or the user answers.

If the issue body already specifies everything (scope, folder, behavior), say so briefly in the plan and continue.

### 3. Plan and approval

Write a short plan: scope, files or folders, main behavior, and how you will verify in the browser.

- **User is in the chat:** present the plan and wait for explicit approval before coding.
- **Issue thread:** post the plan as a **Comment** and wait for an approval reply on the issue (for example “approved” or “go ahead”) unless the ticket author already gave full acceptance criteria in the body.

Do not write implementation code until approval is clear.

### 4. Build

Implement in the workspace. One project, one folder. Keep `CLAUDE.md` index rows in sync with new or renamed projects.

Use a **feature branch** for the ticket (for example `issue-<n>-short-slug`), not the default branch, so a pull request can be opened later. Create the branch before or when you start implementation.

### 5. Run and verify in the browser

Use the Cursor browser MCP (Chrome DevTools-backed): navigate, interact, snapshot, `browser_take_screenshot`, and `browser_cdp` when you need DOM or runtime checks.

- Static HTML under `todo/` or similar: serve over `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` (for example a short `node` static server). `file://` is blocked in the automation browser.
- Exercise the paths the ticket cares about: create, update, filter, persist after reload, error cases when relevant.
- Capture at least one screenshot that shows the feature working. Use fresh screenshots immediately before any coordinate click.

### 6. Open a pull request (before closing the issue)

After build and browser verification:

1. Ensure the ticket work is **committed** on the feature branch. Rely on the stop hook to commit and push when possible; if the hook has not run yet, ask the user before pushing, or wait for the next stop.
2. **Push** the feature branch to `origin` if it is not on the remote yet (`git push -u origin HEAD`). On `gh` write 403, push from the terminal if credentials work, or ask the user to push.
3. **Create a PR** into the repo default branch (`main` / `master`). Prefer `gh pr create` with title/body linking the issue (for example `Closes #<n>` or `Fixes #<n>` only when you are about to close after merge). On 403, create the PR in the browser.
4. Post an issue **Comment** with the **PR URL**, a short summary of changes, and how you verified. **Attach verification screenshot(s)** to that comment when you can (browser: **Paste, drop, or click to add files**). Do not close the issue yet.

**Wait for manual review and approval** on the PR (review comments addressed, approval given, or merge completed — whichever the repo expects). Leave the issue **open** while the PR is pending.

- **User in chat:** stop after the PR comment and wait until they say the PR is approved or merged.
- **Loop / issue-only:** on later ticks, skip this issue until the PR is approved or merged, or until there is an explicit approval comment on the issue or PR.

Do not apply `answered` or close the issue until the PR step is approved.

### 7. Close the ticket on GitHub

Run this step **only after** the pull request has passed manual review (and merge, if your process requires it).

Post a **final Comment** if anything changed since the PR comment (optional if the PR comment already covers verification). **Attach screenshot(s)** when the skill requires proof on the ticket.

Apply the `answered` label, dismiss the label menu so it saves, then **Close issue** → **Close as completed** with an empty comment box. Do not use **Close with comment** for the verification post.

Verify with `gh issue view <n> --json state,stateReason,labels,comments` and `gh pr view` (or the PR page) that the PR state matches your process.

## Factual-only tickets

1. **Signal** — 👀 on the issue.
2. **Answer** — check the fact before writing. No repo changes.
3. **Comment**, **answered** label, **close as completed**, **verify** with `gh` as below.

## Comment shape

**Build or feature (PR ready — issue stays open):**

```markdown
Pull request: <PR URL>

<What was built or changed, and where to open or run it.>

<How you verified in the browser; mention reload or filter behavior when relevant.>

<Screenshot(s) attached below when possible.>

Awaiting manual PR review before this issue is closed.
```

**Build or feature (final close comment, after PR approval):**

```markdown
<PR merged or approved — optional one-line pointer to the PR URL.>

<What shipped; where to open or run it if not obvious from the PR.>
```

**Clarifying questions (issue left open):**

```markdown
I have a few questions before implementing:

1. ...
2. ...
```

**Plan awaiting approval:**

```markdown
## Plan

- ...
- ...

Reply here when you approve and I will implement.
```

**Factual question only:**

```markdown
<Direct answer.>

<One or two sentences with the figure or source that supports it, and the common mix-up when there is one.>
```

## Browser writes on GitHub

Issue URL: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>`

- **Issue number vs ticket title:** GitHub issue `#n` is not always the same as “Ticket #N” in the title (for example “Ticket #4” may be issue `#5`). Use `gh issue list` / the issue title to pick the right `#n`.
- React: open **React**, choose 👀.
- Comment: fill **Add a comment**, attach screenshot files when closing build tickets, click **Comment**. For React-controlled textareas, use `browser_type` or set `HTMLTextAreaElement` value via the native setter and dispatch an `input` event — plain `textarea.value = …` can submit as `undefined`.
- Label: **Edit Labels**, filter `answered`, check **answered** (create if missing), then dismiss the menu so the label saves.
- Close: post the verification **Comment** first (with screenshot). Leave the comment box empty, then **Close issue** → **Close as completed**. Do not use **Close with comment** for the verification post. Stop when the control says **Reopen issue**.
- If the comment composer fails to load, reload the issue page before commenting.

## Loop behavior on build tickets

On each factory-loop tick, read open issues in number order. Skip closed issues.

- If your last comment on an issue was **questions** or a **plan** and there is no approval or answer yet, skip that issue.
- If you already opened a **PR** for the issue and commented with the PR link, skip until the PR is **approved or merged**, or until the user or issue thread gives explicit go-ahead to close.
- If the PR is approved or merged, run **§7 Close the ticket** (and skip back to build unless follow-up work is requested).
- Otherwise run the full build workflow for the oldest actionable issue, one issue per tick when possible.
